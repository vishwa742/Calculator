# Individual Calculator

This github repository is for a calculator that was built using Python that has automated unit tests. The calculator has functions for the following operations:

-  Addition
-  Subtraction
-  Multiplication 
-  Division
-  Square
-  Square root

In this project we have used static and dynamic methods of calling objects. We have also used [CSV](https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/) files to store input data for the tests.
